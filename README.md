Figure 1. Morphological changes and thickening of the epidermis from 5mm to 8mm of Standard Lenght (SL) during development of zebrafish. A-C Post-embryonic zebrafish developmental stages 5, 6.5 and 8mm SL respectively, Scale bar 1mm. D, The bilayer of epidermal cells in larvae of 5mm is restricted by a thin collagen matrix in green between epidermis and muscle tissue. E, The epidermis of larvae of 6 mm SL with presence of specialized cells: the mucous goblet cells in the upper cell layer. F, In larvae of 8mm SL the epidermis is at least form by three or four layers specifically on dorsal of the trunk moreover the thickness of collagen matrix is bigger than juvenile larvae and large melanocytes cells underneath her were evident. The transcriptional factor p63 as regulator of epidermis and his distribution during larvae development. G, In 5 mm SL has been localized in the basal layer with a flat conformation. H, The p63 positive cells have distributed mostly along basal layer though with suprabasal positive cells. I, The p63 positive cells have kept for long time and they have spent both basal and suprabasal cells and they have been absent in the upper cell layer, D-I, 63X, Scale Bar 20 microns.

Material and Methods
Masson’s trichrome modified staining from histological sections from paraffin embedded tissues . Briefly the larvae of different stages were fixed in Bouin solution and paraffin embedded blocks as describe (Leica , Microtomy and Paraffin Section Preparation)  have gotten sections of 5um. The samples have been deparaffinized by Xilol and sequential rehydration through decreasing percentage of alcohol. The samples have stained in Hematoxylin of Mayer's solution followed rinse in running tap water. Subsequent stained 1% Fucsina and differentiation of collagen with 1% Phosphomolybdic acid solution besides stain in Methyl Green followed by rinse in distilled water and quickly dehydration with ethanol and cleared in xylene at last mounted with mounting medium (web protocol Masson's Trichrome Staining Protocol for Collagen Fibers).

Immunofluorescence.
The larvae of 5, 6 and 8mm SL have fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde to histological sections of 3um from paraffin embedded tissues. The samples were permeabilized on absolute acetone at −20ºC for 1–2 min on ice. After permeabilization, acetone was diluted with cold PBS afterward subjected to antigen retrieval in 10mM sodium citrate buffer / 0.05% Tween 20 by microwave oven. Blocking 2% Albumin/ 0.05% Tween 20. The slides were incubated with the primary antibody p63 (Biorbyt #orb27455, from recombinant p63 protein (AA 1-205) N-terminal part of DeltaNp63) at 4°C overnight and then incubated with 1:2000 dilution of Alexa Fluor® 488 / 594-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, Inc #115-545-003/#115-585-003) and nuclear counterstains with DAPI and mounted in Vectashield® Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories #H-1000)



As previously described Le Guellec (Le Guellec, Morvan-Dubois et al. 2004) by transmission electron microscopy, the skin in embryos and young larvae before 6mm of standard length is very thin (less tan 10 μm thick).
